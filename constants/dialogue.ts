        "The road south to Oakhaven is dangerous. Full of bandits, they say.",
        "They say the Whispering Woods got their name 'cause the trees themselves are alive... others say it's just the wind.",
        "Some say a great treasure is buried in the swamps to the east... others say it's just mud and monsters.",
        "The smithy is always busy. Valerius is a master of his craft.",

        "The mountains to the north are treacherous. Full of harpies and worse, I hear.",
        "A feywood log is worth a pretty penny, but getting them is the tricky part. The woods are... strange.",
        "Have you seen the ranch west of town? McGregor's got the fattest cows and the fluffiest sheep.",
        "The capital city, Silverhaven... they say the walls are made of pure silver. Don't believe a word of it, but it's a sight to see.",
