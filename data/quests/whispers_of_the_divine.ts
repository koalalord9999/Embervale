/**
 * Quest: Whispers of the Divine (Main Quest)
 * ==========================================
 *
 * Synopsis:
 * -----------
 * Following the stabilization of the Arcane Weave in "The Arcane Awakening," Archmage Theron detects
 * a new, subtle layer of energy emanating from high-level runic altars. Believing they hold a deeper
 * purpose than just rune crafting, he creates an "Attuned Locus" and tasks the player with using it at
 * three powerful, remote altars: the Verdant Altar (Nature/Life), the Nexus Altar (Death/Balance),
 * and the Hex Altar (Curses/Control). At each altar, the Locus allows the player to hear a divine
 * "echo"â€”a cryptic verse from a forgotten god associated with that domain. The player collects these
 * three "Verse Fragments" and returns them to Theron. The archmage deciphers the combined text,
 * revealing a fragment of the world's creation myth concerning these three divine aspects. As a reward,
 * Theron is able to channel the residual divine energy into a cape, allowing the player to choose one
 * of three powerful capes aligned with the aspects they communed with.
 *
 * Why it happened:
 * ----------------
 * The stabilization of the world's magic has made it possible to perceive more ancient and subtle
 * energies. The divine echoes, which have always been present but were previously drowned out by the
 * magical "noise" of the Resonance Cascade, can now be heard by a properly attuned individual using
 * Theron's device.
 *
 * Lore Explained:
 * ---------------
 * - This is a high-level main quest that directly addresses the lore of the gods and the purpose of the altars.
 * - It establishes that the gods of Embrune are not entirely absent but have left behind "echoes" of their
 *   power and consciousness, which are tied to the runecrafting altars.
 * - It reveals that the altars are more than just crafting stations; they are conduits to ancient divine
 *   energies and repositories of forgotten knowledge.
 * - The three aspects explored (Verdant/Nature, Hex/Control, Nexus/Balance) provide a framework for the
 *   world's cosmology and the different types of magic.
 * - The reward (a choice of powerful capes) allows the player to align themselves with one of these divine
 *   aspects, adding a role-playing element and tying game mechanics to lore.
 *
 * Divine Verses Content:
 * ----------------------
 * The following are the three cryptic verses the player receives. These can be used to generate
 * the dialogue when the player receives the fragments and when Theron deciphers them.
 *
 *   1. Verdant Verse (from the Verdant Altar):
 *      "From silent stone, the First Root drank the sun,
 *       Life's green fire, in every leaf and thorn.
 *       The Great Song began, a chorus newly born,
 *       My breath is the wind, my blood the river's run."
 *
 *   2. Nexus Verse (from the Nexus Altar):
 *      "When the Song fades, and the final leaf descends,
 *       To silent dust, all vibrant color blends.
 *       I am the pause, where every story ends,
 *       The patient soil, where new life then depends."
 *
 *   3. Hex Verse (from the Hex Altar):
 *      "Before the Song, there was the single thought,
 *       A pattern drawn, a boundary newly wrought.
 *       I gave the law by which all things are caught,
 *       The binding word, the fate that can't be fought."
 *
 * Approximate Duration:
 * ---------------------
 * Long (60-90 minutes). This is a high-level "messenger" quest. The challenge comes not from new combat
 * encounters introduced by the quest itself, but from the requirement to travel to three separate,
 * dangerous, high-level zones (The Feywood, The Serpent's Coil/Sunken Labyrinth, Whispering Isle Dungeon),
 * implying the player must already be strong enough to survive these locations.
